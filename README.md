The goal of this project is to use the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset (see the References section) to investigate "how (well)" an activity (barbell lift) was performed by 6 participants. Data has been collected by means of on-body sensing approach and the participants were asked one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashion:

* exactly according to the specification (Class A)
* throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
* lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
* lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
* throwing the hips to the front (Class E)

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.
